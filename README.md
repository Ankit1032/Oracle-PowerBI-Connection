# Oracle-PowerBI-Projects

To connect Power BI to an Oracle database, you need to install an Oracle client that is compatible with both Power BI and the version of Oracle database you're using. 
It's recommended to use the same version of Oracle client as Oracle SQL Developer to ensure compatibility.

After installing Oracle client, retsrat your Power BI and follow the below steps:
1. Click on Get Data -> More -> Database -> Oracle Database
2. Provide the connection details in this format : host:port/SID
	for example : localhost:1521/orcl
3. You can use Advance Option to put a SQL Query for fetching data (OPTIONAL)
4. After clicking OK -> Database
5. Now put your user-name and password for that particular schema and then click connect
